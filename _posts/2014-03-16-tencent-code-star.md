This is my practice of Season 1 game, I hope I will have fun and learn something.

## My Speech

This is Mar 16, 2014. The Season 2 competion of the Tencent Code Star is about to release in 4 to 5 days. I got two midterms this week and a Micro P lab demo!! I have to teach myself about recommender system and submit my first result by Saturday midnight. Can not imagine the life before graduating in one year. 

Anyway, I have to start to earn some credits for the furture job.

## Overview

This the Season one of the Code Star. From my understanding, this about the front-end of trouble shooting and problem solving skills of Web. It can be tell from the organizer of the game. It is called Tencent Alloy Team(腾讯Web前端团队).
