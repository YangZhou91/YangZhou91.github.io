## My Speech

This is Mar 16, 2014. The Season 2 competion of the Tencent Code Star is about to release in 4 to 5 days. I got two midterms this week and a Micro P lab demo!! I have to teach myself about recommender system and submit my first result by Saturday midnight. Can not imagine the life before graduating in one year. 

Anyway, I have to start to earn some credits for the furture job.
