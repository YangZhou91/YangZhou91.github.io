I was recently pissed off by Malaysia, of reaction for MH370. So, my passion towards hacker skills was activated. 

## Overview
I had previous experience BackTrack 5. I was only using Wifi related tools, but there are so many tools I didn't use before. I did a little bit research which turns out the SQLMap is the easist tool to start with. 

sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers.

## Approach
First of all, we need to find vulnerable website which has some potential for injection. We can simply use google to do this.
